What is hashing?
Hashing is a technique used for storing, retrieving and removing information as quick as possible.

It is a process of converting a arbitrary size key into fixed size value, this conversion is done via special function called Hash Function.

The operation supported by hashing such as storing, retrieving and removing information and have average runtime complexity of O(1).


What are Hash Function?
A hash function simply takes an arbitrary size key and provides fixed size value also called as index.


What is Moular Hash Function?
A modular hash function takes a key and size and returns a remainder by dividing key by size.

The remainder is used as an index to store the key in an array of provided size.
